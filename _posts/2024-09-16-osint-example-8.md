# Solution + Thought Process


1. My initial thought on this problem was to find a tool that would allow me to translate the article to English. Luckily, Google Translate does just the job.

2. Looking at our translated article, we can conclude that the audience is applauding a performance from Shen Yun. Doing a little more research, we find that Shen Yun is the world's premier classical Chinese dance and music company. Part A completed!


3. After confirming that the article is from a Shen Yun performance, we can begin trying to figure out when this photo was taken. It is easy to choose the date when the article was published (January 12, 2023), but the photo would have to be taken at least a day before the article was published.


4. I took some time to search through a few different articles discussing the performances. Ironically, I found the same photo that was used in the problem statement! It also includes a caption that should give us the answer to Part B and Part C!

5. According to this screenshot the performance was held at the **Chrysler Hall** in Norfolk, Virginia, on **January 7**. This simultaneously provides the answers to B and C. We're done!
